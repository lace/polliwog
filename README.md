A 2D and 3D computational geometry library, including geometric operations,
transforms, and primitives like planes, polygonal chains, and axis-aligned
bounding boxes. Lightweight and pure Python.

The goals of this project are:

- Keep dependencies light and deployment flexible.
- Keep the library working in current versions of Python and other tools.
- Respond to community contributoions.
- Eventually provide a complete set of functionality for this problem domain.

## Features

Geometric operations, transforms, and primitives, in 2D and 3D.

The [most commonly used of these](__init__.py) are directly imported into
`polliwog`.

- [polliwog.Box](polliwog/box/box.py) represents an axis-aligned
  cuboid.
- [polliwog.Plane](polliwog/plane/plane.py) represents a 2-D plane in
  3-space (not a hyperplane).
- [polliwog.Polyline](polliwog/polyline/polyline.py) represents an
  unconstrained polygonal chain in 3-space.

`polliwog.transform` includes code for 3D transforms.

- [polliwog.transform.CompositeTransform](polliwog/transform/composite.py)
  represents a composite transform using homogeneous coordinates. (Thanks avd!)
- [polliwog.transform.CoordinateManager](polliwog/transform/coordinate_manager.py)
  provides a convenient interface for named reference frames within a stack of
  transforms and projecting points from one reference frame to another.
- [polliwog.transform.find_rigid_transform](polliwog/transform/rigid_transform.py)
  finds a rotation and translation that closely transforms one set of points to
  another. Its cousin `find_rigid_rotation` does the same, but only allows
  rotation, not translation.
- [polliwog.transform.rotation.rotation_from_up_and_look](polliwog/transform/rotation.py)
  produces a rotation matrix that gets a mesh into the canonical reference frame
  from "up" and "look" vectors.

Other modules:

- [polliwog.tri.barycentric](polliwog/tri/barycentric.py) provides a function for
  projecting a point to a triangle using barycentric coordinates.
- [polliwog.segment](polliwog/segment/segment.py) provides functions for working with
  line segments in n-space.


## Installation

## Acknowledgements

This collection was developed at Body Labs and includes a combination of code
developed at Body Labs, from legacy code and significant new portions by
[Eric Rachlin][], [Alex Weiss][], and [Paul Melnikow][]. It was extracted
from the Body Labs codebase and open-sourced by [Alex Weiss][] into a library
called [blmath][], which was subsequnetly [forked by Paul Melnikow][blmath fork].
This library and the 3D geometry and linear-algebra toolbelt [vg][] were later
extracted.
