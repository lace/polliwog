    Compute barycentric coordinates for the projection of a set of points to a

    These barycentric coordinates can refer to points outside the triangle.
    This happens when one of the coordinates is negative. However they can't
    specify points outside the triangle's plane. (That requires tetrahedral
    coordinates.)

    The returned coordinates supply a linear combination which, applied to the
    vertices, returns the projection of the original point the plane of the
    triangle.

    Args:
        vertices_of_tris (np.arraylike): A set of triangle vertices as `kx3x3`.
        points (np.arraylike): Coordinates of points as `kx3`.

    Returns:
